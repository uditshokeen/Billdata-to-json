# Billdata-to-json
This Python project extracts structured data from scanned bills or invoices (in image or PDF format) and outputs the data in JSON format. It uses Tesseract OCR for text extraction, Poppler for PDF-to-image conversion, and OpenAI's GPT for intelligent field detection and data organization.
